Exam Scheduler App

release date: 17/06/2023


Differences with Software Requirements Specifications Document (SRS):
 * 
 * 	Extra functionality:
 * 
 * 1) The secretary can add more than one professor name while inserting courses(separated with commas).
 * 
 * 2) Not all rooms have the same capacity. Amphitheaters and auditoriums have different capacities 
 *    (values which the secretary inserts to the program).
 *
 * 3) Since the number of enrolled students depends on secretary's input, it isn't certain that all students can be accommodated
 * in one room. Professors select rooms until no students remain.
 * 
 * 4) The secretary is also required to select exam period and start/end date (although not used in the current version).
 * 
 * 5) All rooms are available when selecting an available time since two courses can't be scheduled simultaneously.
 *	
 * 6) UC05 — Insert number of rooms: capacities are also required.
 * 
 * 7) UC06 — Insert Course: also requires number of enrolled students
 * 
 * 8) UC07 — The schedule can be viewed through the SecretaryGUI2 window [View Schedule] button and not through the RoomsGUI.
